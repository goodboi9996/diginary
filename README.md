100 search queries per day

## TODO:
- AI
  - ~~Search (from Google and whitelist)~~
  - Recommended (brute force get a few thousand from previous google searches, rank them)
  - Updating profiles (user and resources are compared w/ cosine similarity)
- Get frontend (probably from template, after ui is done)
- Backend (probably hardcoded due to lack of time)
- Manual suggestions + feedback + manual testing at account creation
